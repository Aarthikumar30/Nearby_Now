# Nearby_Now
Nearby Now is a local service finder web application designed to connect users with trusted service providers in their area. The platform allows users to easily search for services like plumbing, electrical work, home cleaning, tutoring, and more. Each provider is listed with detailed profiles, user ratings, and reviews to ensure transparency and informed decision-making.

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, and hosted locally with XAMPP, the system includes separate login modules for users, service providers, and admins. It supports features like user registration, provider management, service categorization, and feedback collection.

The goal of this project is to create a reliable and user-friendly platform that simplifies access to essential local services while supporting small businesses and strengthening community engagement.
